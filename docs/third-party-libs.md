# Third Party Libs


### The multiple scenarios for Typescript Type Definitions?

In `typescript`, when using a third party library there are now essentially **4 scenarios** in what concerns type definitions:

1. No type definitions of any kind are available
1. Type definitions are available and shipped together with the compiler itself
1. A library does not ship with type definitions, but they can be installed separately
1. A library ships with its own type definitions built-in
